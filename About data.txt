🧠 Contextual Behavior

The agent should:

Prioritize resume phrasing, responsibility verbs, and achievement quantification.

Detect patterns in how professionals describe their security projects.

Avoid collecting duplicate or irrelevant data (like sales or IT support roles).

If fewer than 10 are found, expand company scope while maintaining role relevance.
