Context
Environmental sensor telemetry data, detailed in the blog post, Getting Started with IoT Analytics on AWS, published on Towards Data Science.

Content
The data was generated from a series of three identical, custom-built, breadboard-based sensor arrays. Each array was connected to a Raspberry Pi devices. Each of the three IoT devices was placed in a physical location with varied environmental conditions.

| device            | environmental conditions                 |
|-------------------|------------------------------------------|
| 00:0f:00:70:91:0a | stable conditions, cooler and more humid |
| 1c:bf:ce:15:ec:4d | highly variable temperature and humidity |
| b8:27:eb:bf:9d:51 | stable conditions, warmer and dryer      |
Each IoT device collected a total of seven different readings from the four sensors on a regular interval. Sensor readings include temperature, humidity, carbon monoxide (CO), liquid petroleum gas (LPG), smoke, light, and motion. The data spans the period from 07/12/2020 00:00:00 UTC â€“ 07/19/2020 23:59:59 UTC. There is a total of 405,184 rows of data.

The sensor readings, along with a unique device ID and timestamp, were published as a single message, using the ISO standard Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) network protocol. Below is an example of an MQTT message payload.
